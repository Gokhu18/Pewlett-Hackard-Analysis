# Challenge Object

*new list of potential mentors*: created a query that returns a list of current employees eligible for retirement, as well as their most recent titles(**partition** the data so that each employee is only included on the list once).

The final query should return the potential mentorâ€™s *employee number, first and last name, their title, birth date and employment dates*.

## Process

Creating a list of candidates for the mentorship program by using SQL perform several queries.

1. Use an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to understand relationships between SQL tables.


2. Create new tables (challenge_emp_info) in pgAdmin by using different joins.


3. Write basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.

```

-- Number of title Retiring
SELECT ce.emp_no AS Employee_number,ce.first_name, ce.last_name, 
    t.title AS Title, t.from_date, s.salary AS Salary
INTO challenge_emp_info
FROM current_emp AS ce
INNER JOIN titles AS t ON ce.emp_no = t.emp_no
INNER JOIN salaries AS s ON ce.emp_no = s.emp_no;

```


```
-- for each employee ONLY display the most recent title
-- by using partition by and row_number() function.

SELECT employee_number, first_name, last_name, title, from_date, salary
INTO current_title_info
FROM (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY (cei.employee_number, cei.first_name, cei.last_name)
                ORDER BY cei.from_date DESC) AS emp_row_number
      FROM challenge_emp_info AS cei) AS unique_employee	  
WHERE emp_row_number =1;

-- Get frequency count of employee titles 
SELECT *, count(ct.Employee_number) 
		OVER (PARTITION BY ct.title ORDER BY ct.from_date DESC) AS emp_count
FROM current_title_info AS ct;
```

4. Export new tables to a CSV file.
